<h3>My Delicious Shirred Eggs </h3>
<p>These eggs are simple yet elegant thanks to dairy and a shirring technique.</p>
<p>The difference between over-hammered, dry eggs and fluffy, restaurant-rich ones is just a little technique. Grab some chopsticks!</p>
<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
    <li>eggs</li>
    <li>milk or sour cream</li>
    <li>butter, oil, or margarine</li>
</ul>
<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Grease a pan set to medium-low heat with butter, oil, or margarine.</li>
    <li>Scramble egg yolks and add milk or sour cream, mixing further.</li>
    <li>Add egg mixture to pan, continuously stirring and breaking up egg curds with chopsticks until eggs are fluffy and still slightly moist.</li>
</ol>
